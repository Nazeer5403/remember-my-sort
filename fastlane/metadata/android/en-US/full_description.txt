Forces the Android system file picker (DocumentsUI) to persist sort preferences across directories and sessions.

<b>The Problem</b>
Android 11+ requires apps to use the system file picker for storage access. This picker resets sort order to filename A-Z whenever entering subdirectories. Users must manually re-sort every time.

<b>The Fix</b>
Hooks DocumentsUI sort handling to persist user preference. Manual sort changes are saved and restored automatically. Defaults to date descending on first run.

<b>Requirements</b>
- LSPosed framework (API 100+)
- Android 11+ (API 30)
- Root access

<b>Supported Packages</b>
- com.google.android.documentsui (Google/Pixel devices)
- com.android.documentsui (AOSP ROMs)

<b>Installation</b>
1. Install LSPosed (JingMatrix fork recommended)
2. Install this module
3. Enable in LSPosed Manager
4. Add DocumentsUI package to module scope
5. Force stop DocumentsUI
